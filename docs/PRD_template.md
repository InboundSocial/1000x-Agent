1. Overview & Background
   Why are we doing this?
   This section sets the stage. It should be a concise summary that anyone in the company can read to understand the project at a high level.

1.1. Problem Statement: What specific user problem, business need, or market opportunity are we addressing? Be specific. Use data if you have it (e.g., "25% of users drop off at the checkout page because our payment form is confusing.").
1.2. Vision: Briefly describe the desired future state once this project is complete. What does the world look like for our users? How does this align with our broader company goals or product strategy? 2. Goals & Success Metrics
How will we know if we've succeeded?
Define what success looks like in measurable terms. This is critical for assessing the impact of your work after launch.

2.1. Objectives: What are the high-level goals?
Example: Increase user engagement, reduce support tickets, drive new revenue.
2.2. Key Results (Metrics): How will we measure the objectives? These must be quantifiable.
Example: Achieve a 15% increase in Daily Active Users (DAU) within 3 months of launch.
Example: Reduce support tickets related to 'billing issues' by 30%.
Example: Generate $50k in new ARR in the first quarter post-launch. 3. User Personas & Scenarios
Who are we building this for, and how will they use it?
This section builds empathy and focuses the team on the end-user.

3.1. Target User(s): Define the primary (and secondary, if any) user personas for this feature. Link to more detailed persona documents if they exist.
Example: 'Creative Carla', a freelance graphic designer who needs to quickly invoice clients.
3.2. User Scenarios / Use Cases: Describe typical scenarios where the user will interact with this feature. Frame it as a short story.
Example: Carla has just finished a logo project. She opens our app, creates a new invoice, adds the client's details and line items, and sends it directly to their email. She receives a notification when the client has viewed the invoice. 4. Requirements & Features (The "What")
What are we actually building?
This is the core of the PRD. Be detailed and unambiguous. User stories are a popular and effective format.

4.1. Feature Breakdown: Break the project down into logical components.
User Story Format: As a [user type], I want to [perform an action] so that [I can achieve a goal].
Example 1: As a freelancer, I want to create an invoice from a template so that I can bill my clients faster.
Example 2: As a freelancer, I want to see if my client has opened the invoice so that I can follow up appropriately.
4.2. Functional Requirements: For each user story, list the specific functional requirements (the "acceptance criteria").
For Example 1 above:
Must be a button "New Invoice from Template" on the dashboard.
System must display a list of user-saved templates.
User can select a template to pre-fill the invoice.
...etc.
4.3. Non-Functional Requirements: These are requirements that don't relate to a specific feature but to the system as a whole.
Performance: How fast should it be? (e.g., Page must load in under 2 seconds).
Security: Are there specific data protection or privacy concerns? (e.g., All financial data must be encrypted).
Accessibility: What level of accessibility do we need to meet? (e.g., Must be WCAG 2.1 AA compliant).
Legal/Compliance: Any legal constraints? (e.g., Must comply with GDPR). 5. Scope
What is in, and more importantly, what is out?
Clearly defining what you are not doing is one of the most important parts of a PRD to prevent "scope creep."

5.1. In Scope for v1: List the major features/user stories that are part of this initial release.
5.2. Out of Scope (Future Work): Explicitly list features that were considered but are being deferred to a future release. This manages expectations.
Example: "Support for multiple currencies will be addressed in v2."
Example: "An automated recurring invoice feature is out of scope for this project." 6. Design & User Experience (UX)
What should it look like and feel like?
Provide links to design artifacts. This section is a bridge between product and design.

6.1. Wireframes & Mockups: Link to Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD files. Embed images of key screens if possible.
6.2. User Flow Diagram: Link to or embed a diagram showing the user's journey through the new feature.
6.3. Interaction Details: Any specific animations, transitions, or interaction patterns to note? 7. Dependencies, Assumptions, and Risks
What could go wrong or block us?
This section shows you've thought ahead and are prepared to navigate challenges.

7.1. Dependencies:
Technical: Does this feature depend on another team's API? A new infrastructure component?
Team: Do we need support from Marketing for the launch? Legal for a review?
7.2. Assumptions: List any assumptions you're making that, if proven false, could impact the project.
Example: "We assume users are willing to connect their bank account for this feature to work."
7.3. Risks: What are the potential risks and what is your mitigation plan?
Example: Risk: A key API partner has a history of outages. Mitigation: Build a graceful error-handling state for when the API is down. 8. Go-to-Market & Launch Plan
How will we release this to the world?
This coordinates the product release with other teams like Marketing, Sales, and Support.

Phasing: Will this be a full launch or a phased rollout (e.g., internal beta, open beta, %-based GA)?
Marketing & Comms: Key messaging points, blog post plans, social media announcements.
Support Readiness: Plan for training the customer support team, preparing help-desk articles. 9. Open Questions
What do we still need to figure out?
It's okay not to have all the answers. Listing open questions makes them visible and assigns ownership.

Example: @Designer - Do we need a separate mobile view for the invoice summary page?
Example: @Engineer - What is the technical lift for integrating with the new payment provider? 10. Appendix & Related Documents
