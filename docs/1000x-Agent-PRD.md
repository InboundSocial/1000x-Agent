**Status:** Draft

### **1. Overview & Background**

The 1000x Agent is an AI-powered communications hub designed for small service-based businesses. These businesses often face significant operational strain from managing high volumes of incoming communications across various channels like SMS, phone calls, and email.

This agent will act as an intelligent virtual dispatcher, capable of understanding and acting upon customer requests. Its primary function is to automate the tasks typically handled by a call service representative or administrative staff, such as booking and managing appointments, answering frequently asked questions, and sending confirmations.

By automating these front-line communications, the 1000x Agent aims to directly address key business goals: improving operational efficiency, minimizing staffing costs, and increasing revenue by ensuring no lead or appointment request is missed.

### **3. Users & Personas**

**Persona 1: Sam, the Service Pro (Business Owner)**

- **Background:** Sam owns a local home service business (e.g., plumbing, HVAC, electrical). He is an expert in his trade but is often overwhelmed by the administrative side of the business.
- **Technical Skill:** Low. He relies on a managed service to integrate the technology into his existing CRM and calendar.
- **Goals:** See a consistently full calendar of booked jobs, reduce overhead costs, and avoid missing new business opportunities.
- **How the Agent Helps:** The agent completely offloads the initial communication and booking process. Sam simply sees confirmed appointments appear on his calendar.

**Persona 2: Maria, the Modern Homeowner (End Customer)**

- **Background:** Maria needs to hire a professional for a service at her home. She is busy, tech-savvy, and expects immediate, efficient service.
- **Goals:** Quickly get a price quote, book or reschedule an appointment with minimal friction, and understand the service offerings.
- **Expectations:** Speed, clarity, a seamless process, and proactive communication.
- **How the Agent Helps:** The agent provides instant, 24/7 responses, answers questions clearly, books appointments in a single interaction, and keeps her informed.

### **6. Technical Architecture**

**6.1. Transient Assistant Model**

Instead of creating persistent VAPI assistants for each client, the system uses a **transient assistant architecture**:

1. Each client is provisioned with a unique phone number
2. The number and client details are stored in Supabase
3. When a call arrives, the system looks up the client by phone number
4. A transient assistant is programmatically created with client-specific configuration
5. The assistant exists only for the duration of that call

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates complexity of managing multiple persistent assistants
- Allows dynamic configuration based on real-time client data
- Simplifies updates to assistant behavior across all clients
- Reduces VAPI resource usage

### **7. Dependencies**

- **External Services:** VAPI (voice), GoHighLevel (CRM), Supabase (credential vault & vector DB), Doppler (secrets).
- **Internal Teams:** Client Onboarding Team (for setup and KB management), Development Team.
- **Data:** High-quality, client-specific Knowledge Bases are critical for the Q&A feature.
